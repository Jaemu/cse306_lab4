4.1: The cmpl $(NR_syscalls), %eax instruction compares the value stored in the %eax register (the index to the syscall table) to NR_syscalls, which is translated to 344.  The next instruction is jae syscall_badsys, which will get executed if the value stored in %eax is equal or higher than 344.  This prevents any syscall referenced by any index >= 344 from being called from user space.

4.2: The registers in ascending order, starting from the one closest to %esp:
- %ebx, argument 1
- %ecx, argument 2
- %edx, argument 3
- %esi, argument 4
- %edi, argument 5
- %ebp, argument 6
- %eax, system call number
